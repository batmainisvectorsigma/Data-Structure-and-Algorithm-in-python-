# Stack in python

Here I am going to write about stacks in python 

For this think of a tower of plate 
A data structure in which all insertions and deletion are made at one end and, and called the top of the stack.

Last in First Out





## Some Methods

- append(item): add item to top of stack
- push(item): push item to the top of the stack
- pop(item): remove and return the top item 
- peek(item): return the top item without removing item
- is_empty(item): return true if the stack is is_empty

## More

Stack inserttion and deletion happpen at the same time 

## Application

- reverse polish notation for evaluating arithmetic expressions
- Syntax parsing
- Cold Stack
- Used in recursion
- Undo and redo operations in word processors
- Low level assembly programming 

## Simple program
